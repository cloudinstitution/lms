# Duplicate Password Reset UI Cleanup

## Issue Description
The login page had duplicate password reset functionality that was causing confusion. When users clicked "Forgot password?" on the login page, they were seeing a local password reset component instead of being redirected to the dedicated `/forgot-password` page.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Login Page Cleanup (`/app/login/page.tsx`)

**Removed:**
- All password reset state variables (isPasswordResetMode, resetStep, passwordStrength, etc.)
- `handlePasswordReset` function and all related logic
- Password reset form components and conditional rendering
- Broken/incomplete code fragments

**Updated:**
- "Forgot password?" link now uses `<Link href="/forgot-password">` instead of `onClick` handler
- Simplified card header and description (removed password reset mode conditionals)
- Clean, focused login form with only essential login functionality

### 2. OTP Expiration Time

**Verified Settings:**
- API route: `5 * 60 * 1000` (5 minutes) in `/app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts`
- Frontend: `setCountdownTime(300)` (5 minutes) in `/app/forgot-password/page.tsx`
- Email templates: All mention "5 minutes" expiration time

### 3. Current State

**Login Page (`/login`):**
- Clean, focused login form
- "Forgot password?" link redirects to `/forgot-password`
- No duplicate password reset functionality
- Show/hide password toggle for login password field

**Forgot Password Page (`/forgot-password`):**
- Complete 3-step password reset flow (email → OTP → new password)
- 5-minute OTP expiration with countdown timer
- Resend OTP functionality
- Password strength validation
- Show/hide password toggles
- User type indication (student/admin/teacher)

## Files Modified

1. **app/login/page.tsx** - Removed duplicate password reset logic
2. **app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts** - Already had 5-minute OTP expiration
3. **app/forgot-password/page.tsx** - Already had 5-minute countdown timer

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Only one password reset interface (`/forgot-password`)
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear navigation flow from login to password reset
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removed duplicate and broken code from login page
4. **Consistent Timing**: 5-minute OTP expiration across all components
5. **Proper Separation**: Login and password reset are now separate, focused components

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify "Forgot password?" link on login page redirects to `/forgot-password`
2. Test complete password reset flow on `/forgot-password` page
3. Confirm 5-minute OTP expiration and countdown timer work correctly
4. Ensure resend OTP functionality works properly
5. Test both student and admin/teacher password reset flows

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED**: Duplicate password reset UI removed from login page
✅ **COMPLETED**: OTP expiration set to 5 minutes (already implemented)
✅ **COMPLETED**: Clean navigation from login to dedicated password reset page
✅ **COMPLETED**: No code errors or broken functionality
