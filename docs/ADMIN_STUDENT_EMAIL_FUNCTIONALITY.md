  }
}
```

### Frontend Implementation

  singleStudent: null
});
```

## Email Template Features

### HTML Email Template
- **Professional Design**: Clean, modern layout with Cloud Institution branding
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Email Logging

### Firestore Collection: `email_logs`
**Document Structure**:
```json
{
  "type": "bulk_student_email",
  "recipient": "student@example.com",
  "recipientName": "Student Name",
  "recipientId": "student123",
  "subject": "Email subject",
  "message": "Email content",
  "messageId": "nodemailer-message-id",
  "status": "sent" | "failed",
  "error": "error message if failed",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-09T10:30:00Z",
  "sentBy": "admin"
}
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```env
GMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
```

### Gmail Setup
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on Gmail account
2. Generate App Password for the application
3. Use App Password (not regular password) in `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`

## User Experience

### Bulk Email Flow
1. **Select Students**: Use checkboxes to select multiple students
2. **Click Send Email**: Button appears when students are selected
3. **Compose Email**: Fill in subject and message
4. **Send**: Click send button
5. **Feedback**: Toast notification shows success/failure
6. **Reset**: Selected students are cleared after successful send

### Individual Email Flow
1. **Click Email Icon**: In student row actions menu
2. **Auto-Target**: Dialog shows "Send email to 1 student"
3. **Compose**: Same interface as bulk email
4. **Send**: Targets only the selected student
5. **Feedback**: Toast notification confirms delivery

## Error Handling

### API Level
- Validates required fields (studentIds, subject, message)
- Checks email configuration availability
- Handles Firebase connection errors
- Manages individual email sending failures
- Logs all attempts (success and failure)

### Frontend Level
- Loading states during email sending
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Error messages for failed operations
- Form validation for required fields
- Graceful handling of API failures

## Security Features

1. **Admin Authentication**: Only authenticated admin users can send emails
2. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
3. **Rate Limiting**: Controlled by email provider (Gmail)
4. **Audit Trail**: All email activities are logged
5. **Error Containment**: Individual failures don't affect batch processing

## Performance Considerations

1. **Batch Processing**: All emails sent in parallel for efficiency
2. **Error Isolation**: Individual failures don't stop other emails
3. **Logging**: Non-blocking logging operations
4. **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large student lists

## Testing Scenarios

### Bulk Email Testing
1. **Multiple Students**: Select 3-5 students and send test email
2. **Large Batch**: Test with 20+ students (if available)
3. **Mixed Results**: Test with valid and invalid email addresses
4. **Network Issues**: Test behavior during network interruptions

### Individual Email Testing
1. **Single Student**: Test individual student email functionality
2. **Student Verification**: Confirm correct student receives email
3. **Error Cases**: Test with invalid student data

### Error Testing
1. **Invalid Email Config**: Test with wrong Gmail credentials
2. **Network Failures**: Test API timeout scenarios
3. **Invalid Student IDs**: Test with non-existent students
4. **Empty Fields**: Test form validation
