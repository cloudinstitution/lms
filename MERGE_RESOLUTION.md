### Issues Fixed:

# If this was the only conflict, complete the merge
git commit -m "resolve: fix merge conflicts in attendance page

- Remove duplicate imports (useAuth, getAdminSession)
- Add missing useNewAttendance hook initialization
- Clean up code structure and resolve TypeScript issues"

# If there were other conflicts, resolve them first, then commit
```

## 🔍 Verification

The file now:

- ✅ Properly initializes the useNewAttendance hook
- ✅ Has no TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Maintains all functionality for:
  - Manual attendance marking

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Complete the git merge with the commands above
2. Test the attendance functionality to ensure everything works
3. Check other files for any remaining merge conflicts
4. Deploy when ready

The attendance system should now work correctly with the dual-collection implementation and proper admin ID resolution!
